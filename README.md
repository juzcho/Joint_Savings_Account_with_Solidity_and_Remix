## Joint Savings Account

This project is about creating an application to automate the creation of a join savings accounts with the use of Solidity smart contract. This smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

## Technologies

This project leverages **[python version 3.8.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** with the following packages and modules:

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - *version 1.3.2* - This was used to be able to easily manipulate dataframes and create dataframes.

* [hashlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html)- This module implements a common interface to many different secure hash and message digest algorithms. In our application, we use SHA256 to return a hexdigest.

* [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html) - This is a Python library for connecting to and performing operations on Ethereum-based blockchains.

* [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/) - This is used to create the smart contract and implement the joints saving application to work with ether.

* [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) - This is used to be able to write and edit solidity formatted code, and this is where the joints saving application will be launched.

## Installation/ Usage Guide

### 1. Use [REMIX IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to view and edit the `joint_savings.sol` file.

- Make sure to `git clone` the file first from this repository. 

### 2. Then when on the REMIX IDE, click on the left icon logo, and then click Open file and navigate to where the git clone files are locally saved on your machine.

- This should open the file through this IDE for you to compile the smart contract.
